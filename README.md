#Pokelist
By NathanaÃ«l Gimenez

##Reasons

Project made during my studies at the Ecole des Mines de Nantes to learn how to develop in Android

##The project

The app fetches pokemons from the [Pokemon api](http://pokeapi.co) and displays them in a list. A click on a pokemon displays its details in a new view. If you are on landscape orientation, the details are displayed next to the list

It is a very, very basic app made in order to learn. In the future I may develop it further in order to improve my knowledge of Android. Like, there are no tests currently.
